Hello,
This is my fifth project for the API unit. This is an app that utilizes the Random User API that I used to generate 12 random "employees" at my imaginary startup. The user is able to click on any employee and see their name, photo, city, phone number, address and email. The user can then exit out of the modal to return to the full list of employees. Upon refreshing the page. the employee list will change entirely. I am going for Meets Expectations on this project.

Thanks!
   Stephany
